Copy the git clone url from the right side of the project webpage at github. Start git shell, ```cd (directory)``` go to directory you want clone to and enter ```git clone ``` followed by the url you just copied. This will put a copy of the project on your local machine. If repo is already on local machine use ```git pull``` to get updated documents.
##Step 2
Change directory to working directory ```cd (directory)```
##Step 3
Create or edit files in your working directory

```git add (filename)```
##Step 5
Adds comments to file before upload
```git commit -m (a few words of comment, double-quoted)```
##Step 6

```git push```
